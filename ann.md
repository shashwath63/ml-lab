Sure, let's break down this code:

```python
import numpy as np
```
This line imports the numpy library, which provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

```python
# Input data (features)
X = np.array([[2, 9], [1, 5], [3, 6]], dtype=float)
```
This line defines the input data or features for the neural network. The data is stored in a 2D numpy array of floating point numbers.

```python
# Output data (labels)
y = np.array([[92], [86], [89]], dtype=float)
```
This line defines the output data or labels for the neural network. The data is stored in a 2D numpy array of floating point numbers.

```python
# Normalize input data
X = X / np.amax(X, axis=0)
```
This line normalizes the input data by dividing each element by the maximum value in its column. Normalization is a common preprocessing step in machine learning that can help the model learn more effectively.

```python
# Normalize output data
y = y / 100
```
This line normalizes the output data by dividing each element by 100. The specific normalization factor depends on the range of the output data.

```python
# Sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```
This function defines the sigmoid activation function, which is commonly used in neural networks to introduce non-linearity into the model and to map any input to a value between 0 and 1.

```python
# Derivative of sigmoid function
def dersig(x):
    return x * (1 - x)
```
This function defines the derivative of the sigmoid function, which is used during the backpropagation step of training the neural network.

```python
# Neural network parameters
e = 7000  # Number of epochs
lr = 0.1  # Learning rate
iln, hln, oln = 2, 3, 1  # Input, hidden, and output layer sizes
```
These lines define several parameters for the neural network:
- `e` is the number of epochs, or iterations over the entire dataset, to train for.
- `lr` is the learning rate, which controls how much the model changes in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.
- `iln`, `hln`, and `oln` are the sizes of the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer, respectively.

```python
# Initialize weights and biases
wh = np.random.uniform(size=(iln, hln))
bh = np.random.uniform(size=(1, hln))
wout = np.random.uniform(size=(hln, oln))
bout = np.random.uniform(size=(1, oln))
```
These lines initialize the weights and biases for the neural network. The weights and biases are the parameters that the model will learn. The weights are initialized to small random values. The biases are also initialized to small random values.

```python
# Training the neural network
for i in range(e):
```
This line starts a loop that will iterate `e` times. Each iteration represents one epoch of training.

```python
    # Forward pass
    h1 = np.dot(X, wh)
    h = h1 + bh
    hla = sigmoid(h)
    oi1 = np.dot(hla, wout)
    oi = oi1 + bout
    op = sigmoid(oi)
```
These lines perform the forward pass of the neural network. The input data is passed through the network, and the sigmoid activation function is applied to the outputs of the neurons in the hidden layer and the output layer.

```python
    # Backpropagation
    EO = y - op
    og = dersig(op)
    dop = EO * og
    EH = dop.dot(wout.T)
    hg = dersig(hla)
    dhl = EH * hg
```
These lines perform the backpropagation step of the neural network. The error of the output is calculated and then propagated back through the network. This involves calculating the derivative of the activation function and the error of the neurons in the hidden layer.

```python
    # Update weights and biases
    wout += hla.T.dot(dop) * lr
    wh += X.T.dot(dhl) * lr
```
These lines update the weights of the neural network based on the errors calculated during the backpropagation step. The learning rate `lr` is used to control the size of the updates.

```python
# Display results
print("Input: \n" + str(X))
print("Actual Output: \n" + str(y))
print("Predicted Output: \n", op)
```
These lines print the input data, the actual output data, and the output predicted by the neural network after training. This can be used to check how well the model has learned to predict the output based on the input.

Sure, let's break down these lines of code:

```python
h1 = np.dot(X, wh)
```
This line performs a dot product operation between the input data `X` and the weights of the hidden layer `wh`. The result `h1` is a matrix that represents the input data after being transformed by the weights.

```python
h = h1 + bh
```
This line adds the bias `bh` to the transformed input data `h1`. The bias allows the neural network to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can be critical for successful learning.

```python
hla = sigmoid(h)
```
This line applies the sigmoid activation function to the result `h`. The sigmoid function maps any input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. The result `hla` is the output of the hidden layer.

```python
oi1 = np.dot(hla, wout)
```
This line performs a dot product operation between the output of the hidden layer `hla` and the weights of the output layer `wout`. The result `oi1` is a matrix that represents the output of the hidden layer after being transformed by the weights.

```python
oi = oi1 + bout
```
This line adds the bias `bout` to the transformed output of the hidden layer `oi1`. As with the hidden layer, the bias allows the neural network to shift the activation function to the left or right.

```python
op = sigmoid(oi)
```
This line applies the sigmoid activation function to the result `oi`. The result `op` is the final output of the neural network. This output is then compared to the actual output `y` during the training process, and the weights and biases are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs. This is how the neural network learns from the data.

Sure, let's break down these lines of code:

```python
EO = y - op
```
This line calculates the error of the output `EO` by subtracting the predicted output `op` from the actual output `y`. This error represents how far off our predictions are from the actual values.

```python
og = dersig(op)
```
This line applies the derivative of the sigmoid function to the predicted output `op`. The derivative of the sigmoid function at a certain input value represents the slope of the sigmoid function at that point. This is used to determine how much the output of the neural network would change with respect to a small change in the input.

```python
dop = EO * og
```
This line calculates the delta of the output `dop` by multiplying the output error `EO` by the derivative of the sigmoid of the output `og`. This delta represents the direction and amount we want to update our weights in order to reduce the error.

```python
EH = dop.dot(wout.T)
```
This line calculates the error of the hidden layer `EH` by taking the dot product of the output delta `dop` and the transpose of the output weights `wout.T`. This error represents how much the hidden layer contributed to the output error.

```python
hg = dersig(hla)
```
This line applies the derivative of the sigmoid function to the output of the hidden layer `hla`. As before, this represents the slope of the sigmoid function at the output of the hidden layer.

```python
dhl = EH * hg
```
This line calculates the delta of the hidden layer `dhl` by multiplying the hidden layer error `EH` by the derivative of the sigmoid of the hidden layer output `hg`. This delta represents the direction and amount we want to update our weights in the hidden layer in order to reduce the error.

These steps are part of the backpropagation algorithm, which is used to train neural networks. The goal of backpropagation is to adjust each weight in the network in proportion to how much it contributes to the overall error. It does this by using the chain rule to calculate the derivative of the error with respect to each weight in the network, which can then be used to adjust the weights to minimize the error. The backpropagation algorithm is repeated for a certain number of epochs, or complete passes through the training dataset, until the network is adequately trained and the error is minimized.

Sure, let's break down these lines of code:

```python
wout += hla.T.dot(dop) * lr
```
This line updates the weights of the output layer `wout`. The update is calculated by taking the dot product of the transpose of the hidden layer activations `hla.T` and the output delta `dop`, and then multiplying by the learning rate `lr`. This operation effectively applies the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the error of the neural network's predictions. The weights are adjusted in the direction that reduces the error.

```python
wh += X.T.dot(dhl) * lr
```
This line updates the weights of the hidden layer `wh`. The update is calculated by taking the dot product of the transpose of the input data `X.T` and the hidden layer delta `dhl`, and then multiplying by the learning rate `lr`. Similar to the output layer, this operation applies the gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize the error of the hidden layer's output. The weights are adjusted in the direction that reduces the error.

In both lines, the learning rate `lr` controls the size of the updates. A smaller learning rate means that the weights will be updated slowly, which can make the training process longer but can also result in a better final set of weights. A larger learning rate means that the weights will be updated quickly, which can speed up the training process but can also cause the updates to overshoot the optimal set of weights. The learning rate is typically set through trial and error. The goal of these updates is to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs, which is how the neural network learns from the data.
